# Console-Finances

## Description 

Used Javascript to financially analyse and summarise a dataset for a fictional company.

This project was a good stretch and practise of using Javascript, as well as problemsolving. We had to research the majority of our solutions, which proved very difficult and I discovered the importance of mentoring! I now have a grasp on multi-dimensional arrays, for/else loops and maths!
